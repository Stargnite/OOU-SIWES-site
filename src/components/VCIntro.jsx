          Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) unit of our great

          Directorate works in collaboration with the Industrial Training Fund
          (ITF) to ensure that students in Industrial attachment require
          adequate practical exposure that will enhance their competence and
          self-reliance after graduation. The Directorate is under the office of
          the Vice Chancellor.
